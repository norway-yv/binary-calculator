# Binary calculator
A calculator, where you write two binary numbers and receive the binary answer as a byte.
There are two variations, compact and full. The full version is made for readability, with several files for use in the frontend file. The compact version is not made for readability, but runs the same way as the full version and is only one file. All edits will first be made in the full version, so if you want the newest version you should create a local version of the full program. 

I plan on expanding this later, for example by allowing the program to only use two bits for two-digit numbers, and so on. I may also add functionality to add 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit numbers, but I do not plan on doing this until either Tabnine becomes intelligent enough to do it for me (it is not hard, but boring and repetitive) or I get access to GitHub copilot.
