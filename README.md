# Binary calculator
A calculator, where you write two binary numbers and receive the binary answer as a byte.
There are two variations, compact and full. The full version is made for readability, with several files for use in the frontend file. The compact version is not made for readability, but runs the same way as the full version and is only one file. All edits will first be made in the full version, so if you want the newest version you should create a local version of the full program. 

Currently, it can calculate any binary numbers with only hardware restrictions.
Further expansion may include conversion between binary and decimal numbers.
